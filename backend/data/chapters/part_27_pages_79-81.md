portfolio and program management to achieve predefined objectives and enhance underlying processes. Daily tasks in enterprises are frequently organized around projects, such as market opportunity analysis, portfolio definition, or product design. Therefore, project management must be optimized within companies in terms of methodologies and tools for planning, executing, and closing projects.

**【译文】** 持续的监控和控制对于**项目组合和项目群管理**至关重要，以实现预定目标并优化底层流程。企业的日常任务通常围绕项目展开，例如市场机会分析、投资组合定义或产品设计。因此，企业必须在项目规划、执行和结项的方法论与工具方面优化项目管理。

In the context of corporate operations management, operating model practices are established. Companies can choose whether to outsource operations to shared services or manage them internally. Generally, a hybrid strategy is applied, combining both options. The final subprocess of the Manage Projects and Operations process involves managing sustainable operations.

**【译文】** 在企业运营管理（Corporate Operations Management）的背景下，需要建立运营模式实践。企业可以选择将运营外包给共享服务中心（Shared Services），或在内部进行管理。通常，企业会采用结合这两种选择的混合策略。“管理项目与运营”流程的最后一个子流程涉及管理可持续运营（Sustainable Operations）。

For businesses, sustainability is not only about environmental protection but also about enhancing their image and brand. Being a sustainable company also aids in regulatory compliance and avoiding financial penalties.

**【译文】** 对于企业而言，可持续性不仅关乎环境保护，还涉及提升企业形象和品牌。成为一家可持续发展的公司也有助于合规，避免因违规而遭受经济处罚。

3.9 Finance

Cost accounting, a subfield of management accounting, focuses on capturing the total production costs by considering both variable and fixed expenses. This enables managers to identify and reduce unnecessary expenditures while maximizing profits. In the analysis phase, plans are compared to the information recorded during the operational phase, allowing for the identification of deviations and the implementation of corrective measures.

**【译文】** ### 3.9 财务 (Finance)

成本会计（Cost Accounting）是管理会计（Management Accounting）的一个子领域，专注于通过综合考虑变动成本和固定费用来捕捉总生产成本。这使得管理者能够识别并减少不必要的支出，同时实现利润最大化。在分析阶段，将计划与运营阶段记录的信息进行对比，从而识别偏差并实施纠正措施。

The objective of the Invoice to Pay process is to ensure that bills are paid and to monitor the company’s outstanding debts. Supplier invoice management handles invoices from suppliers after a service has been provided or a product delivered. Payables management is in charge of tracking financial assets, starting with managing financial settlements and continuing with processing accounts payables to maintain a comprehensive financial overview.

**【译文】** “从发票到付款”（Invoice to Pay）流程的目标是确保按时支付账单，并监控公司的未偿债务。供应商发票管理（Supplier Invoice Management）处理在服务提供或产品交付后收到的供应商发票。应付账款管理（Payables Management）负责跟踪金融资产，从管理财务结算开始，接着处理应付账款，以维持全面的财务概览。

---

This process also includes payables financing, which is responsible for clearing supplier invoices and making payments to the appropriate creditors. Accounts payable, an account within the general ledger, represents an organization’s obligation to pay off debts to its creditors or suppliers. The total outstanding amounts owed to suppliers are shown as the accounts payable balance on the company’s balance sheet, with increases or decreases from the previous period reflected on the cash flow statement. Payable financing is a type of credit where companies borrow money from a supplier to purchase products and goods.

**【译文】** 该流程还包括应付账款融资（Payables Financing），负责结清供应商发票并向相应的债权人付款。应付账款（Accounts Payable）是总账（General Ledger）中的一个科目，代表组织偿还债权人或供应商债务的义务。欠供应商的未偿总额在公司资产负债表上显示为应付账款余额，其相对于上一期间的增减则反映在现金流量表中。应付账款融资是一种信贷形式，即企业通过从供应商处“借款”来购买产品和货物（即利用商业信用）。

Invoice to Cash, similar to Invoice to Pay, involves customers owing debt to the company. Customer invoice management handles pre-invoicing of billing content, as well as managing third-party invoices and incorporating them into the invoice sent to the customer if necessary. Receivables management ensures orderly receipt of payments, beginning with financial settlements management and continuing with customer credit risk management.

**【译文】** “从发票到收款”（Invoice to Cash）与“从发票到付款”类似，但涉及的是客户欠公司的债务。客户发票管理（Customer Invoice Management）处理计费内容的预开票，以及管理第三方发票并在必要时将其纳入发送给客户的发票中。应收账款管理（Receivables Management）确保有序收到款项，从财务结算管理开始，接着进行客户信用风险管理。

Accounts receivable and disputes are processed, and receivable financing and collection processing are carried out. Accounts receivable represents the balance of money owed by customers for goods or services received. Recorded on the balance sheet as a current asset, accounts receivable reflects the amount of money owed by customers for credit purchases. Comparable to accounts payable, accounts receivable focuses on money to be received rather than money owed.

**【译文】** 在此过程中，系统会处理应收账款和争议，并执行应收账款融资和收款处理。应收账款（Accounts Receivable）代表客户因已收到的货物或服务而欠下的金额余额。应收账款作为流动资产记录在资产负债表上，反映了客户因赊购而欠下的金额。与应付账款相比，应收账款关注的是待收回的资金，而不是欠下的债务。

---

Accounts receivable can be analyzed using the turnover ratio or days sales outstanding to estimate when the money will actually be received. Receivables financing is relevant when customers receive funding based on issued invoices for purchased goods or services but payment has not yet been received. Treasury management deals with bank interactions and finalizes the payment process.

**【译文】** 可以通过周转率或应收账款周转天数（DSO）来分析应收账款，以估算实际收到款项的时间。当客户基于已购买货物或服务的已开具发票获得融资，但尚未收到付款时，应收账款融资（Receivables Financing）就变得相关。资金管理（Treasury Management）处理银行交互并完成支付流程。

The Record to Report subprocess consists of creating a financial record, performing financial accounting, executing financial closing, and generating financial reports. The process of generating information for management to assess the company’s status is facilitated by financial accounting, a branch of accounting that documents, consolidates, and communicates the numerous transactions arising from business activities over a specific period.

**【译文】** “从记录到报告”（Record to Report）子流程包括创建财务记录、执行财务会计、执行财务结账以及生成财务报告。财务会计（Financial Accounting）是会计的一个分支，负责记录、合并和传达特定时期内商业活动产生的大量交易，它促进了生成供管理层评估公司状况所需的信息。

---

These transactions are condensed into financial statements, including the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement, which reflect the organization’s operational performance during a given timeframe. Financial accounting adheres to various established accounting principles, which are subject to the company’s regulatory and reporting requirements.

**【译文】** 这些交易被浓缩为财务报表，包括反映组织在特定时间范围内运营绩效的资产负债表、损益表和现金流量表。财务会计遵循各种既定的会计原则，这些原则受公司的监管和报告要求约束。

For instance, businesses in the United States must conduct financial accounting in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), ensuring consistent information for investors, creditors, regulators, and tax authorities. Financial closing is a recurring process in management accounting, where accounting teams verify and adjust account balances at the end of a specified period (e.g., annually or quarterly) to create financial reports for the company.

**【译文】** 例如，美国的企业必须按照公认会计原则（GAAP）进行财务会计核算，以确保为投资者、债权人、监管机构和税务机关提供一致的信息。财务结账（Financial Closing）是管理会计中一个周期性的流程，会计团队在特定期间（如每年或每季度）结束时核实并调整账户余额，以便为公司创建财务报告。

---

The objective is to inform management, investors, lenders, and regulatory agencies about the company’s financial position. Closing the books involves consolidating transactions from multiple accounts, reconciling the data to ensure its accuracy, and identifying discrepancies and anomalies. It is crucial that the total of all debits equals the total of all credits.

**【译文】** 其目的是向管理层、投资者、贷款人和监管机构通报公司的财务状况。结账（Closing the books）涉及合并来自多个账户的交易，核对数据以确保其准确性，并识别差异和异常。在此过程中，确保所有借方总额等于所有贷方总额至关重要。

The general ledger accountant, closing specialist, business analyst, and consolidation expert are the four primary roles responsible for maintaining accounting accuracy and transparency. Every company has bank accounts that handle incoming and outgoing cash flows due to payments, which must be monitored and managed. In small businesses, accounting or management may handle this task, but as a company grows, larger and more complex payment transactions typically require one or more full-time positions, such as a treasurer or treasury department.

**【译文】** 总账会计、结账专员、业务分析师和合并专家是负责维护会计准确性和透明度的四个主要角色。每个公司都有处理因收付款而产生的资金流入和流出的银行账户，这些账户必须得到监控和管理。在小企业中，会计或管理层可能会处理这项任务，但随着公司规模的扩大，更大、更复杂的支付交易通常需要一个或多个全职职位，如财务主管（Treasurer）或资金部门。
