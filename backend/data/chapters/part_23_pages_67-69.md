Simultaneously, promotional efforts are devised and supervised, with specific customer demographics identified to target the appropriate audience. This allows marketing initiatives to be implemented effectively. The resulting data enables the analysis of and response to customer insights, identifying potential buyers interested in particular products or services. Within the Opportunity to Quote subprocess of Sales Execution, various channels like the Internet or local stores are utilized for sales purposes. Moreover, shopping carts and checkouts are managed through self-service, along with the handling of leads, opportunities, and points of sale. It is also essential to review sales proposals, received bids, and quotes, adapting and managing the configuration of products and services, and determining and calculating sales prices. Following successful customer acquisition, negotiating and processing a customer contract is necessary within the Order to Fulfill context. Such contracts are defined in the Customer Order and Contract Management subprocess and stored in the relevant system. This allows for the management of customer contracts and orders, as well as the orchestration of the fulfillment process. Ultimately, entitlements can be managed, and once a customer order is completed, production processes commence. However, orders with special requests may result in alterations to the overall design.

**【译文】** 同时，制定并监督促销工作，并确定特定的客户群体以瞄准合适的目标受众。这使得营销计划能够被有效实施。由此产生的数据使企业能够分析并响应客户洞察，识别对特定产品或服务感兴趣的潜在买家。在“销售执行 (Sales Execution)”的“机会到报价 (Opportunity to Quote)”子流程中，利用互联网或实体店等各种渠道进行销售。此外，购物车和结账通过自助服务进行管理，同时还需处理线索 (leads)、商机 (opportunities) 和销售点 (points of sale) 业务。审查销售提案、收到的投标和报价，调整和管理产品及服务的配置，以及确定和计算销售价格也至关重要。成功获客后，需要在“订单到履行 (Order to Fulfill)”背景下协商并处理客户合同。这些合同在“客户订单与合同管理 (Customer Order and Contract Management)”子流程中定义，并存储在相关系统中。这使得企业能够管理客户合同和订单，并协调履行流程。最终，可以对权益 (entitlements) 进行管理，一旦客户订单完成，生产流程随即开始。然而，带有特殊要求的订单可能会导致整体设计的变更。

Order to Fulfill also involves processes like project management, which includes planning the optimization of order fulfillment and delivering the product or service for fulfillment.

**【译文】** “订单到履行”还涉及项目管理等流程，其中包括规划订单履行的优化工作，以及交付产品或服务以完成履行。

The primary objective of Request to Service is to manage customer service and support. In the past, the emphasis on brand building and loyalty was placed on creating and producing exceptional products. While providing excellent service has its advantages, businesses primarily focused on the products they sold, with service often considered secondary. This is alluded to by the term after-sales service, which refers to fixing broken items. Good service was mainly employed to enhance a product’s reputation and price, while the service itself was viewed as a cost center. The shortcomings of this previous approach are now evident. As companies seek comprehensive experiences rather than just products, the service function is becoming an essential component of the overall offering and value proposition, as well as a source of profit.

**【译文】** “请求到服务 (Request to Service)”的主要目标是管理客户服务和支持。在过去，品牌建设和客户忠诚度的重点在于创造和生产卓越的产品。虽然提供优质服务有其优势，但企业主要关注他们销售的产品，服务通常被视为次要的。这一点从“售后服务 (after-sales service)”一词中可以看出，它主要指修理损坏的物品。优质服务主要用于提升产品的声誉和价格，而服务本身被视为成本中心 (cost center)。这种旧方法的缺点现在显而易见。随着公司追求全面的体验而不仅仅是产品，服务职能正成为整体产品和价值主张的重要组成部分，以及利润的来源。

Additionally, in today’s competitive landscape, businesses cannot depend solely on reactive break-fix services, which are invariably more costly and less profitable than a well-managed and efficient service operation. To maximize their service business and retain their customer base, companies need service contracts that account for both reactive and predictive scenarios, along with service offerings that are designed, planned, and managed as a profitable part of the company portfolio. To drive these changes, companies are altering how the service department is integrated into their organizations. Service is shifting from a local cost center to a central business offering and must be planned, managed, and controlled accordingly. The ongoing transformation from a strictly cost-driven to a business-driven approach to service is happening alongside an increasing emphasis on solution selling, where service is just one aspect of a deal that boosts profitability through products, subscriptions, contracts, services, and even projects.

**【译文】** 此外，在当今的竞争格局中，企业不能仅仅依赖被动的故障维修服务，因为与管理良好且高效的服务运营相比，这种服务的成本总是更高，利润更低。为了最大化服务业务并留住客户群，公司需要涵盖被动和预测场景的服务合同，以及作为公司投资组合中盈利部分进行设计、规划和管理的服务产品。为了推动这些变革，公司正在改变服务部门融入组织的方式。服务正在从局部的成本中心转变为核心业务产品，必须相应地进行规划、管理和控制。这种从严格的成本驱动向业务驱动的服务方式的持续转型，正伴随着对解决方案销售 (solution selling) 的日益重视而发生，其中服务只是通过产品、订阅、合同、服务甚至项目来提高盈利能力的交易的一个方面。

Request to Service focuses on all support activities needed after delivering tangible or intangible products to customers. These customer services can be provided through various channels, such as the Internet or telephone hotlines. This process manages customer service issues, inquiries, and complaints, which can lead to returns that are also overseen by Request to Service. Warranty claim management is another crucial aspect, along with handling recalls and customer recovery claims during the service process. A reliable after-sales process, including complaint handling, repairs, and returns processing, is essential for most businesses. The returns process should be of high quality, featuring transparent handling, efficient management, and a prompt refund process. The sale of returned, refurbished, or recycled products is becoming more prominent, contributing to the development of a circular economy. Return and refund clerks face daily challenges in managing these intricate processes. Accelerated returns management in sales is utilized to oversee buyer and supplier returns, offering numerous advanced functions for returns management.

**【译文】** “请求到服务”专注于向客户交付有形或无形产品后所需的所有支持活动。这些客户服务可以通过互联网或电话热线等各种渠道提供。该流程管理客户服务问题、咨询和投诉，这些可能会导致退货，退货同样由“请求到服务”流程监管。索赔管理 (Warranty claim management) 是另一个关键方面，此外还包括在服务过程中处理召回和客户追偿索赔。一个可靠的售后流程，包括投诉处理、维修和退货处理，对大多数企业至关重要。退货流程应具备高质量，具有透明的处理方式、高效的管理和迅速的退款流程。退货、翻新或回收产品的销售正变得越来越重要，有助于循环经济的发展。退货和退款专员在管理这些复杂流程时面临着日常挑战。销售中的加速退货管理用于监管买方和供应商的退货，为退货管理提供了许多高级功能。

Following a completed customer delivery, a successfully provided service, or the fulfillment of a customer contract, the Customer Invoice Management subprocess of Invoice to Cash takes place, followed by billing. This step covers the preparation of pre-billing invoice content and includes the administration of third parties if subcontractors are involved. Eventually, the invoice is sent to the customer. Receivables Management deals with financial settlement, customer credit risk control, and accounts receivable processing. Additionally, disputes are resolved, receivables financing is managed, and collections are processed. Billing clerks play a vital role in overseeing the entire billing process, collaborating closely with internal sales representatives, shipping specialists, and accounts receivable accountants to ensure timely creation of billing documents and prompt customer payments without complaints.

**【译文】** 在完成客户交付、成功提供服务或履行客户合同之后，即进入“发票到现金 (Invoice to Cash)”流程中的“客户发票管理 (Customer Invoice Management)”子流程，随后是计费。这一步骤涵盖了预计费发票内容的准备，如果涉及分包商，还包括第三方管理。最终，发票被发送给客户。“应收账款管理 (Receivables Management)”处理财务结算、客户信用风险控制和应收账款处理。此外，还要解决争议、管理应收账款融资以及处理收款。计费专员在监督整个计费流程中发挥着至关重要的作用，他们与内部销售代表、发货专员和应收账款会计密切合作，以确保及时创建计费单据并促使客户迅速付款且无投诉。
