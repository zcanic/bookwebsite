The primary objective of treasury management is to maintain the company’s solvency by controlling its liquidity. Treasury Management tasks also include risk management in corporate finance, asset management, and capital procurement. Treasury management is often considered a subfield of financial management in many organizations. While financial management focuses on managing financial resources to meet revenue targets, treasury management emphasizes ensuring liquidity at all times. Financial management outlines the financial plan containing strategies for achieving the company’s financial objectives, while treasury management ensures the implementation of strategies defined for short- to medium-term goals.

**【译文】** 资金管理（Treasury Management）的主要目标是通过控制流动性来维持公司的偿债能力。资金管理的任务还包括企业财务中的风险管理、资产管理和资本筹集。在许多组织中，资金管理通常被视为财务管理的一个子领域。虽然财务管理侧重于管理财务资源以实现收入目标，但资金管理强调确保持续的流动性。财务管理制定包含实现公司财务目标策略的财务计划，而资金管理则确保针对中短期目标所定义的策略得到执行。

One responsibility of treasury management is liquidity or cash management, which involves capturing and controlling cash flows of liquid funds for the company’s internal and external financing, with the goal of maintaining solvency. Corporate financial risk management is also a key focus of treasury management. To ensure a company’s success, it is crucial to manage payment flows in a way that prevents any deficits that could lead to late payments. Efficient management of these cash flows necessitates the implementation of treasury management. The task of liquidity management involves ensuring that a company’s working capital is utilized in the most efficient and effective manner, ultimately helping the organization achieve its long-term financial goals, such as increasing revenue and reducing costs.

**【译文】** 资金管理的一项职责是流动性管理或现金管理，这涉及获取和控制用于公司内部及外部融资的流动资金现金流，目的是维持偿债能力。企业财务风险管理也是资金管理的一个重点。为了确保公司的成功，至关重要的是管理支付流，以防止出现任何可能导致逾期付款的赤字。这些现金流的高效管理需要实施资金管理。流动性管理的任务涉及确保公司最高效、最有效地利用营运资金，最终帮助组织实现其增加收入和降低成本等长期财务目标。

Real Estate Management plays a crucial role in overseeing a company’s property assets. This process starts with the development and planning of a real estate strategy and extends to the acquisition and integration of properties. Focusing on profit-driven and value-based procurement, management, and marketing of real estate, Real Estate Management is particularly important for organizations that do not have real estate as their core business. These properties are often referred to as corporate real estate. After allocating the real estate and workspace, operational processes such as rent payments, regular inspections, and maintenance are carried out. When the real estate is no longer required, it is retired. The management of real estate master data is a vital task and is also taken into consideration.

**【译文】** 房地产管理（Real Estate Management）在监管公司物业资产方面发挥着至关重要的作用。这一流程始于制定和规划房地产战略，并延伸至物业的收购和整合。房地产管理侧重于以利润驱动和基于价值的方式进行房地产的采购、管理和营销，这对于不以房地产为核心业务的组织尤为重要。这些物业通常被称为企业房地产（Corporate Real Estate）。在分配房地产和工作空间后，将执行租金支付、定期检查和维护等运营流程。当不再需要该房地产时，它将被退役。房地产主数据的管理是一项至关重要的任务，也被纳入考量之中。

3.10 Conclusion
Even though ERP systems have been in existence for quite some time, there is no widely accepted understanding of their functional range. To address this issue, we proposed a reference business process definition for organizations, which acts as a functional blueprint for ERP systems. In this chapter, we touched upon these business processes to illustrate the potential of artificial intelligence in enhancing the automation capabilities of ERP functions. All organizations revolve around four key domains: customer, supply, corporate, and products/services.

**【译文】** 3.10 结论
尽管企业资源规划（ERP）系统已经存在了很长时间，但在其功能范围上并没有被广泛接受的统一定义。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了针对组织的参考业务流程定义，作为 ERP 系统的功能蓝图。在本章中，我们探讨了这些业务流程，以说明人工智能在增强 ERP 功能自动化能力方面的潜力。所有组织都围绕四个关键领域运转：客户、供应、企业和产品/服务。

The fundamental business processes within these domains include idea to market, source to pay, plan to fulfill, lead to cash, recruit to retire, acquire to decommission, governance, and finance. We provided a concise overview of these reference business processes, which are the foundation for defining an ERP reference architecture, in the next chapter.

**【译文】** 这些领域内的基本业务流程包括创意到上市（Idea to Market）、寻源到付款（Source to Pay）、计划到交付（Plan to Fulfill）、线索到现金（Lead to Cash）、招聘到退休（Recruit to Retire）、购置到报废（Acquire to Decommission）、治理和财务。我们提供了这些参考业务流程的简要概述，这是下一章定义 ERP 参考架构的基础。

4 ERP Reference Architecture
For embedding artificial intelligence into ERP software, knowing the underlying architecture is necessary. However, the solution architecture of ERP varies according to the various vendors. In order to address this issue, we abstract from the various ERP products and propose a reference architecture. Thus, we can systematically incorporate our suggested artificial intelligence concepts into the ERP reference architecture and guarantee their validity independent of the underlying ERP vendor. But how to obtain the reference architecture? To resolve this challenge, we reuse the reference processes from the previous chapter to derive the common reference architecture and define the software modules research and development, sales, supply chain, procurement, manufacturing, service, asset management, finance, and human capital management. As a side result, the reference architecture can also be used to evaluate the architecture of different ERP products.

**【译文】** 4 ERP 参考架构
为了将人工智能嵌入 ERP 软件，了解底层架构是必要的。然而，ERP 的解决方案架构因供应商而异。为了解决这个问题，我们从各种 ERP 产品中抽象出来，并提出了一个参考架构。因此，我们可以系统地将建议的人工智能概念纳入 ERP 参考架构，并保证其有效性独立于底层 ERP 供应商。但是如何获得参考架构呢？为了解决这个挑战，我们复用上一章的参考流程来推导通用的参考架构，并定义研发、销售、供应链、采购、制造、服务、资产管理、财务和人力资本管理等软件模块。作为一个附带结果，该参考架构也可用于评估不同 ERP 产品的架构。

4.1 Introduction
Let’s begin with the problem statement. To embed artificial intelligence into ERP software, we must know the underlying architecture. However, the solution architecture depends on the different ERP vendors and vary accordingly. To resolve this challenge, we abstract from the various ERP products and suggest a reference architecture for ERP software. Thus, we can integrate the later introduced artificial intelligence concepts systematically into the ERP reference solution architecture and ensure in addition their validity independent of the ERP vendor. The reference solution architecture implements the reference business processes of enterprises, which we explained in the previous chapter based on corresponding modules. Therefore, embedding artificial intelligence on business process level is also considered. As a side benefit, the proposed reference architecture can be also used to compare the functional and non-functional capabilities of different ERP products.

**【译文】** 4.1 引言
让我们从问题陈述开始。为了将人工智能嵌入 ERP 软件，我们必须了解底层架构。然而，解决方案架构取决于不同的 ERP 供应商，并随之变化。为了解决这个挑战，我们从各种 ERP 产品中抽象出来，并建议一种 ERP 软件的参考架构。因此，我们可以将稍后介绍的人工智能概念系统地集成到 ERP 参考解决方案架构中，并进一步确保其有效性独立于 ERP 供应商。参考解决方案架构实现了企业的参考业务流程，我们在上一章中基于相应的模块对此进行了解释。因此，在业务流程层面嵌入人工智能也被纳入考量。作为附带的好处，所提出的参考架构也可用于比较不同 ERP 产品的功能和非功能能力。
