Prior to finalizing the workforce budget, the projected human and financial resources must be authorized by the management. Organizational Management is responsible for creating the organizational structure and determining employee resourcing requirements, which includes identifying the necessary resources and skill sets to achieve the specified objectives. The goal of the Recruit to Onboard process is to acquire new talent based on prior planning and optimization efforts. This begins with the development of a corporate branding strategy for the organization. Once the required positions are approved, corresponding job requisitions are generated, providing a foundation for potential candidates to apply for open positions. Submitted applications are then matched to available positions, and the most suitable candidates are recruited.

**【译文】** 在最终确定人力预算之前，预计的人力和财务资源必须经过管理层批准。“组织管理”负责建立组织架构并确定员工资源配置要求，这包括明确实现既定目标所需的资源和技能组合。“从招聘到入职”流程的目标是基于之前的规划和优化工作来获取新人才。这始于为组织制定企业品牌战略。一旦所需职位获得批准，系统将生成相应的职位申请单，为潜在候选人申请空缺职位提供基础。提交的申请随后会与可用职位进行匹配，并招募最合适的候选人。

Purchasing requisitions and orders are used to acquire essential equipment for new employees, such as hardware or software. Upon hiring, new employees undergo onboarding, where they are introduced to their tasks, policies, strategies, and other necessary information to become productive. The Develop to Grow process focuses on employees’ growth aspirations and development needs, aiming to strike the ideal balance between individual development goals and organizational and departmental objectives. Managers and employees should engage in ongoing dialogue to support each employee’s short-, medium-, and long-term development, enabling them to apply their strengths and abilities to the company’s advantage.

**【译文】** 采购申请和订单用于为新员工获取必要的设备（如硬件或软件）。录用后，新员工将进行入职引导，了解其任务、政策、战略和其他必要信息，以便快速投入生产工作。“从发展到成长”流程关注员工的成长愿望和发展需求，旨在个人发展目标与组织及部门目标之间找到理想的平衡。管理者和员工应进行持续的对话，以支持每位员工的短期、中期和长期发展，使他们能够发挥自己的优势和能力，为公司创造价值。

Total target cash often comprises a base salary paid monthly, and variable pay or bonuses. Bonuses may be awarded annually or more frequently, such as quarterly, and are given for exceptional achievements by a department or individual employee. High-performing employees are rewarded, for example, by recognizing the employee with the highest sales revenue. The Reward to Retain subprocess aims to retain employees by offering rewards and incentives. In addition to direct financial compensation, companies may provide a comprehensive benefits package to motivate employees to perform at their best and maintain a healthy work-life balance. Benefit offerings are designed to enhance health and productivity while safeguarding employees against risks to future income. These offerings may vary by country and encompass local statutory benefits and requirements, such as sports facilities or health checks. These benefits must be consistently managed and administered.

**【译文】** 目标总现金薪酬通常包括按月支付的基本工资，以及可变薪酬或奖金。奖金可以按年度或更频繁的周期（如季度）发放，用于奖励部门或个人的杰出成就。高绩效员工会获得奖励，例如表彰销售收入最高的员工。“从奖励到留任”子流程旨在通过提供奖励和激励措施来留住员工。除了直接的财务薪酬外，公司还可以提供全面的福利方案，以激励员工发挥最佳表现并保持健康的工作与生活平衡。福利产品的设计旨在增强健康和生产力，同时保障员工免受未来收入风险的影响。这些福利可能因国家/地区而异，包含当地法定福利和要求（例如体育设施或健康检查）。这些福利必须得到统一的管理和执行。

Within the context of HR Administration, employment and employee data are maintained, including administrative information like names, addresses, and ages, as well as contractual data such as full-time employment, salaries, or fixed-term contracts. Depending on career development plans and goal achievement, employees may be promoted to higher levels or, in less favorable cases, demoted. Promotion guidelines must be transparently communicated to employees and managers. To enhance processes and better serve employees’ needs, HR departments regularly conduct reporting and analytics. In an increasingly globalized world, teams may be relocated and restructured, potentially necessitating the physical relocation of employees to other regions. The process of relocation encompasses various aspects such as modifying employment contracts, covering moving costs, and altering pension contributions.

**【译文】** 在“人事管理”范畴内，需要维护雇佣和员工数据，包括姓名、地址和年龄等行政信息，以及全职雇佣、薪资或定期合同等合同数据。根据职业发展计划和目标达成情况，员工可能会被晋升到更高级别，或者在不太理想的情况下被降职。晋升准则必须向员工和管理者透明地传达。为了优化流程并更好地服务员工需求，人力资源部门会定期进行报告和分析。在日益全球化的世界中，团队可能会被重新安置和重组，这可能需要将员工实际调动到其他地区。调动流程包含修改雇佣合同、支付搬迁费用以及变更养老金缴纳等各个方面。

In their daily work, employees often have numerous inquiries related to payroll, contracts, or overtime hours. These inquiries must be systematically managed by the HR administration, for instance, by employing a ticketing solution to process requests efficiently and effectively. Offboarding employees is another crucial aspect, with reasons for termination ranging from changing employers to retirement or fixed-term contracts. Additionally, the employee assistance and retention subprocess focuses on enhancing the employee experience.

**【译文】** 在日常工作中，员工经常会有许多关于薪资、合同或加班时间的咨询。这些咨询必须由人事行政部门进行系统化管理，例如通过使用工单解决方案来高效地处理请求。员工离职管理是另一个关键方面，终止雇佣的原因包括更换雇主、退休或定期合同到期等。此外，员工协助和保留子流程专注于提升员工体验。

The Time Management subprocess ensures that employees record their work and absence times, which is vital for financial and workforce planning, as well as payroll and labor law compliance. Supporting different work patterns and availability, such as part-time jobs and variable workforce rostering, is essential. Typically, working hours are recorded at the activity level, and absence time due to vacations or illness must also be documented. Accurate analysis of an organization’s spending profile and planning is a prerequisite for the Travel and Expense subprocess.

**【译文】** “时间管理”子流程确保员工记录其工作和缺勤时间，这对财务和劳动力规划，以及薪资核算和劳动法合规至关重要。支持不同的工作模式和可用性（如兼职工作和可变劳动力排班）是必不可少的。通常，工时是在活动层级进行记录的，因休假或生病导致的缺勤时间也必须记录在案。对组织支出状况和规划的准确分析是“差旅与费用”子流程的先决条件。

Employees often need to travel for various reasons, necessitating the establishment of a travel and expense process that begins with analyzing travel needs and ends with managing expenses. A travel booking solution that reflects the company’s travel policies is required. Some expenses, like hotel accommodations, are paid by the company in advance, while others, such as taxi fares, are usually paid by the employee and reimbursed later through the reimbursement process. Unpredictable and ad hoc expenses are typically covered by the employee and later requested for reimbursement. Invoices must be submitted and refunded based on the reimbursement process of Payroll and Invoice Pay. The submission and processing of expense invoices are generally automated, as the relevant solutions can convert unstructured documents into relational system records.

**【译文】** 员工经常因各种原因需要出差，因此必需建立一个始于分析差旅需求、终于费用管理的差旅与费用流程。需要一个能反映公司差旅政策的差旅预订解决方案。有些费用（如酒店住宿）由公司预付，而其他费用（如出租车费）通常由员工先行垫付，随后通过报销流程进行报销。不可预测的临时费用通常由员工承担，随后申请报销。发票必须提交，并根据“薪资核算”和“发票支付”的报销流程进行退款。费用发票的提交和处理通常是自动化的，因为相关解决方案可以将非结构化文档转换为关系型系统记录。

Apart from expenses, the monthly salary must be paid to the employee through the payroll process, which takes into account taxes and legal deductions. Examples include church rates, payroll tax, health insurance, and pension insurance, which must be withheld and transferred directly to the respective parties. The Invoice to Pay process deals with supplier invoices and manages payables, while Treasury Management handles actual payments with the bank. This involves managing communication with the bank and transferring salaries to employees’ bank accounts.

**【译文】** 除费用外，每月的工资必须通过薪资核算流程支付给员工，该流程会考虑税收和法定扣除项。例如教会税、工资税、健康保险和养老保险，这些必须被代扣并直接转账给相关方。“从发票到付款”流程处理供应商发票并管理应付账款，而“资金管理”则处理与银行的实际支付。这涉及管理与银行的沟通，并将工资转入员工的银行账户。
