procedures are carried out based on the risk management plan. By systematically addressing potential risks before they arise, a company can save money and safeguard its assets. Another crucial task is sustainability operations, which focuses on managing the environment, health, and safety surrounding the asset. This ensures daily operations are safe, and the workforce is encouraged to identify and address hazards before they impact safety. By maintaining operational continuity, asset integrity is preserved, and production is optimized by minimizing unplanned downtime and outages through proactive identification and mitigation of safety issues.

**【译文】** （缓解）程序是根据风险管理计划执行的。通过在潜在风险发生前系统地加以解决，公司可以节省资金并保护其资产。另一项关键任务是可持续运营，重点是管理与资产相关的环境、健康和安全（EHS）。这确保了日常运营的安全，并鼓励员工在隐患影响安全之前发现并解决它们。通过保持运营的连续性，资产完整性得以维护，并且通过主动识别和缓解安全问题，最大限度地减少非计划停机和中断，从而优化生产。

All of a company’s business processes are interconnected, and as such, they must be considered holistically to achieve a high degree of optimization. To accomplish this, business processes are designed and modelled on a global scale to establish a consistent foundation for implementation.

**【译文】** 公司的所有业务流程都是相互关联的，因此必须从整体角度加以考虑，以实现高度优化。为此，业务流程需要在全球范围内进行设计和建模，从而为实施建立一致的基础。

In addition to optimizing the enterprise, the governance process is responsible for Managing Enterprise Risk and Compliance. This enables an organization to effectively address risk, control, and assurance tasks. To minimize risks and ensure compliance, audits and assurances must be conducted. Business integrity must be maintained, and measures to prevent fraud must be put in place. Regulatory compliance must also be managed by defining appropriate action plans and execution processes.

**【译文】** 除了优化企业外，治理流程还负责“企业风险与合规管理”。这使组织能够有效地处理风险、控制和鉴证任务。为了最大限度地降低风险并确保合规，必须进行审计和鉴证（Assurances）。必须维护业务诚信，并落实防止欺诈的措施。还需要通过定义适当的行动计划和执行流程来管理监管合规性。

The subprocess of Managing Identity and Access Governance is responsible for the technical access to critical infrastructure and systems. This subprocess determines which employees can access specific information within the company through authentication. The entire life cycle management of identities, from provisioning to decommissioning, must be covered. Relevant policies, authentication mechanisms, and corresponding implementation strategies must be defined for this purpose. This also applies to authorizations concerning data, processes, and systems. In addition to information, identity and access governance must also cover other assets, such as buildings.

**【译文】** “身份与访问治理管理”这一子流程负责关键基础设施和系统的技术访问。该子流程通过身份验证决定哪些员工可以访问公司内的特定信息。必须覆盖身份从发放（Provisioning）到注销（Decommissioning）的整个生命周期管理。为此，必须定义相关的策略、身份验证机制和相应的实施策略。这也适用于涉及数据、流程和系统的授权。除了信息之外，身份和访问治理还必须覆盖其他资产，例如建筑物。

The subprocess of Managing Cybersecurity, Data Protection, and Data Privacy addresses these critical aspects of the governance process, as the name suggests. There is an increasing number of data privacy and security requirements, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act, which must be considered for legal compliance within enterprises. Moreover, business data is highly sensitive and valuable, making it a prime target for cybersecurity threats. Successful security attacks can lead to significant financial losses and damage a company’s public credibility. As a result, data privacy measures must be implemented to ensure legal compliance, data protection procedures must be applied to protect business data from unauthorized access, and cybersecurity mechanisms must be deployed to defend the company from security vulnerabilities.

**【译文】** 正如其名，“网络安全、数据保护和数据隐私管理”这一子流程解决了治理流程中的这些关键方面。随着《通用数据保护条例》（GDPR）和《加州消费者隐私法案》等数据隐私和安全要求的不断增加，企业必须考虑法律合规性。此外，业务数据高度敏感且极具价值，使其成为网络安全威胁的主要目标。成功的安全攻击可能导致巨大的经济损失，并损害公司的公众信誉。因此，必须实施数据隐私措施以确保法律合规，应用数据保护程序以保护业务数据免受未经授权的访问，并部署网络安全机制以防御安全漏洞。

The subprocess of Managing International Trade, Tax, and Legal matters ensures that the company adheres to international regulations. In the context of legal matter management, relevant templates and contracts are defined and made available for reuse. This also applies to indirect taxation, which is typically collected by a producer or retailer and paid to the government. International trade involves the exchange of goods and services between countries, allowing consumers and nations access to products and services not available domestically.

**【译文】** “国际贸易、税务和法律事务管理”子流程确保公司遵守国际法规。在法律事务管理的背景下，定义相关的模板和合同并使其可供重复使用。这也适用于间接税，通常由生产者或零售商代收并支付给政府。国际贸易涉及国家之间的商品和服务交换，使消费者和国家能够获得国内无法提供的产品和服务。

The subprocess of Managing IT begins with defining and managing various IT service offerings based on the company’s needs. The demand for IT services depends on the industry in which the company operates. To meet these IT requirements, a service fulfillment strategy and infrastructure concept must be defined. These form the basis for developing and managing the IT infrastructure and software solutions. When using IT solutions, issues or bugs may arise. Users must be able to report these problems and receive assistance in resolving them. To achieve this, IT support must be established to manage and fulfill user requests.

**【译文】** “IT管理”子流程始于根据公司需求定义和管理各种IT服务产品。IT服务的需求取决于公司所处的行业。为了满足这些IT需求，必须定义服务履行策略和基础设施概念。这些构成了开发和管理IT基础设施及软件解决方案的基础。在使用IT解决方案时，可能会出现问题或故障（bugs）。用户必须能够报告这些问题并获得解决帮助。为实现这一目标，必须建立IT支持来管理和满足用户请求。

The subprocess of Managing Projects and Operations comprises five distinct processes, the first of which is ideation management. A company typically employs many individuals, each with their own thoughts and ideas. These ideas can be valuable to the company, and ideation management facilitates the submission of ideas by employees. This boosts employee motivation by valuing their ideas as significant. It’s also essential to recognize those employees whose suggestions are put into practice.

**【译文】** “项目与运营管理”子流程包含五个不同的流程，第一个是创意管理。一家公司通常拥有许多员工，每个人都有自己的想法和创意。这些创意对公司很有价值，而创意管理促进了员工创意的提交。通过重视员工的创意，可以提高员工的积极性。表彰那些建议被付诸实践的员工也是至关重要的。

Portfolio and program management are vital for businesses since they deal with a variety of products and services. As a result, the portfolio must be outlined and planned in line with the company’s product or service strategy. The process of defining a portfolio is already intricate, involving numerous stakeholders and objectives, which may require the establishment of a program for successful implementation. Programs are made up of several concurrently running projects that require coordination and synchronization. Companies have numerous tasks that necessitate the creation of programs for execution. As a result, a standardized methodology must be devised to harmonize the programs, making them more comparable and efficient. Continuous monitoring and control are necessary for

**【译文】** 组合与项目群管理（Portfolio and program management）对企业至关重要，因为它们涉及各种产品和服务。因此，必须根据公司的产品或服务战略来规划和制定组合。定义组合的过程本身就很复杂，涉及众多利益相关者和目标，这可能需要建立一个项目群（Program）以确保成功实施。项目群由多个同时运行的项目组成，需要协调和同步。企业有许多任务需要创建项目群来执行。因此，必须制定标准化的方法来协调项目群，使其更具可比性和效率。（为了实现预定目标并优化底层流程，）持续的监控和控制是必要的。
