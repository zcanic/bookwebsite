negotiating the best prices with an optimal supplier mix. Sourcing is not solely about price; a supplier may offer the best price but fail to deliver or face external challenges, leading to supply chain disruptions or reduced end-product quality.

**【译文】** ……以及与最佳供应商组合谈判最优价格。寻源不仅仅是关于价格；某个供应商可能提供最好的价格，但如果无法按时交付或面临外部挑战，就会导致供应链中断或最终产品质量下降。

---

Procurement typically begins where sourcing ends, creating purchase requisitions and issuing purchase orders for goods or services to the supplier identified during the sourcing process. Overall, the Procure to Receipt process describes the journey from procurement to goods receipt.

**【译文】** 采购通常始于寻源结束之处，即创建采购申请，并向寻源过程中确定的供应商发出货物或服务的采购订单。总体而言，“采购到收货（Procure to Receipt）”流程描述了从采购到货物接收的全过程。

---

The initial phase in the process is Operational Procurement, which aims to identify the necessary products or services for production. Based on this information, appropriate sources are allocated to each required product and service. After selecting a source, the subsequent step involves generating relevant orders and releasing the scheduling agreement. Dock and Yard Logistics manage the coordination of loading bays and traffic within the plant premises. The final subprocess in goods movement is Receiving the ordered items.

**【译文】** 该流程的初始阶段是操作性采购（Operational Procurement），旨在确定生产所需的产品或服务。基于此信息，将适当的货源分配给每个所需的产品和服务。选定货源后，随后的步骤包括生成相关订单并发布计划协议。“月台和堆场物流（Dock and Yard Logistics）”管理工厂区域内装卸区和交通的协调。货物移动的最后一个子流程是接收订购的物品。

---

The reception of products and services varies; services are consumed, while products are stored in a warehouse. Depending on the company’s production strategy and capacities, incoming goods may also be processed immediately.

**【译文】** 产品和服务的接收方式各不相同；服务会被消耗，而产品则存储在仓库中。根据公司的生产策略和产能，入库货物也可能被立即处理。

In numerous industries, there is an increasing shift from traditional business models focused on producing and selling goods to bundling various offerings, such as goods, warranties, ongoing maintenance, and licenses, into a comprehensive service package. A common example is offering a driving experience through leasing options instead of selling a car, along with a service plan, guaranteed work, and standard repairs. Consequently, services are increasingly permeating the core of the business world.

**【译文】** 在众多行业中，商业模式正日益从传统的生产和销售商品，向捆绑各种产品（如商品、保修、持续维护和许可证）的综合服务包转变。一个常见的例子是通过租赁选项提供驾驶体验，而不是直接销售汽车，并附带服务计划、工作担保和标准维修。因此，服务正日益渗透到商业世界的核心。

Employees play a crucial role in operational procurement. When an employee identifies a need, they enter it into the system to place an order. Operational procurement typically involves three main types: stock, consumables, and external services.

**【译文】** 员工在操作性采购中起着至关重要的作用。当员工发现需求时，他们会将其输入系统以发出订单。操作性采购通常涉及三种主要类型：库存、消耗品和外部服务。

---

Stock procurement is often used for direct procurement activities and involves purchasing stock items and storing them in inventory for management and distribution. Consumable items, which are usually indirect items consumed and replenished regularly but not managed as inventory in the system, include items like pens, paper, and coffee for the office kitchen. These items may be ordered by the office manager or directly by an employee who notices a shortage. This kind of indirect purchasing is generally low value and high volume, and due to its high volume, it significantly impacts an organization’s overall expenditure.

**【译文】** 库存采购通常用于直接采购活动，涉及购买库存物品并将其存储在库存中以便管理和分发。消耗品通常是定期消耗和补充的间接物品，但在系统中不作为库存管理，例如办公室厨房的笔、纸和咖啡。这些物品可能由办公室经理订购，或由发现短缺的员工直接订购。这种间接采购通常价值低、数量大，且由于其体量巨大，对组织的整体支出有显著影响。

---

Consumable spending is an ideal area for managing procurement through self-service processes in a system, enabling buyers to concentrate on strategic spending within the organization and allowing the requesting employee to choose precisely what they need without bypassing the organization’s standard approval and spending procedures.

**【译文】** 消耗品支出是通过系统中的自助服务流程管理采购的理想领域，这使得采购员能够专注于组织内的战略性支出，同时允许提出请求的员工精确选择他们所需的物品，而无需绕过组织的标准审批和支出程序。

---

External services procurement encompasses the purchase of services such as building maintenance, consulting, or other tasks suitable for contingent labor. External services are supplied by individuals or groups who are not part of the organization but are engaged solely for a specific project or task. These services can be part of both direct and indirect procurement activities.

**【译文】** 外部服务采购包括购买诸如建筑维护、咨询或其他适合灵活用工（contingent labor）的任务等服务。外部服务由不属于该组织但仅为特定项目或任务聘用的个人或团体提供。这些服务可以是直接采购活动的一部分，也可以是间接采购活动的一部分。

---

Procurement of products or services can sometimes fail, leading to the Request to Resolution process, which handles complaints and returns. When goods or services do not meet expectations, claims arise. After recording and resolving claims with the supplier, the return process begins, usually requiring the supplier to coordinate return transportation.

**【译文】** 产品或服务的采购有时会失败，从而导致“请求到解决（Request to Resolution）”流程，该流程处理投诉和退货。当商品或服务未达到预期时，就会产生索赔。在与供应商记录并解决索赔后，退货流程开始，这通常需要供应商协调退货运输。

---

Analyzing claims helps identify gaps and improve processes and products continuously.

**【译文】** 分析索赔有助于识别差距并持续改进流程和产品。

---

The Invoice to Pay process concludes with payment, involving the receipt and processing of invoices in subsequent stages. Although payments typically occur at the end of a procurement process and the start of a sourcing process, some procurement scenarios challenge the idea of a one-size-fits-all sequence.

**【译文】** “发票到付款（Invoice to Pay）”流程以付款结束，涉及后续阶段的发票接收和处理。虽然付款通常发生在采购流程的末尾和寻源流程的开始，但某些采购场景对这种“一刀切”的顺序提出了挑战。

---

The end-to-end process Finance manages the Invoice to Pay process, which is crucial for procuring goods as it deals with invoice payments. A supplier invoice is a document from a supplier for delivered materials or performed services. Supplier Invoice Management involves processing supplier invoices, obtaining the invoice, and initiating payment.

**【译文】** 端到端流程“财务”管理着“发票到付款”流程，这对于采购商品至关重要，因为它涉及发票支付。供应商发票是供应商针对已交付材料或已执行服务出具的文件。供应商发票管理（Supplier Invoice Management）涉及处理供应商发票、接收发票并发起付款。

---

Financial settlements are incorporated based on accounts payable, and financing payables initiate payments. Financial settlements are the primary element within the process, and accounts payable are processed starting from these settlements. Treasury Management focuses on communicating with banks to process payments and assist with treasury processes such as cash and liquidity management, debt and investment management, and foreign exchange risk management.

**【译文】** 财务结算基于应付账款进行合并，融资应付账款启动支付。财务结算是该流程中的主要要素，应付账款从这些结算开始处理。资金管理（Treasury Management）专注于与银行沟通以处理付款，并协助资金流程，如现金和流动性管理、债务和投资管理以及外汇风险管理。

Manage Suppliers and Collaboration is divided into two subprocesses. The goal of Supplier Management is to organize and analyze existing suppliers. The first step is to certify and validate existing suppliers based on internal criteria, allowing for better classification. Next, supplier information is managed, covering master data and various RFx documents. An up-to-date and comprehensive list of all relevant information is crucial for selecting the right supplier.

**【译文】** “管理供应商和协作”分为两个子流程。供应商管理（Supplier Management）的目标是组织和分析现有供应商。第一步是根据内部标准对现有供应商进行认证和验证，以便更好地分类。接下来是管理供应商信息，涵盖主数据和各种RFx文件。所有相关信息的最新且详尽的列表对于选择合适的供应商至关重要。

---

Suppliers are categorized in a catalog, which can be used for source selection. A final step, conducted in conjunction with suppliers, is performance evaluation. This step enables the company to decide which source to choose for a new order based on previous deliveries. Access to supplier networks is vital, and supplier collaboration platforms are used for this purpose.

**【译文】** 供应商被归类在一个目录中，该目录可用于货源选择。与供应商共同进行的最后一步是绩效评估。这一步使公司能够根据以往的交付情况决定为新订单选择哪个货源。访问供应商网络至关重要，供应商协作平台即用于此目的。

Prior to initiating a service or producing a product, it is essential to establish a supply chain network. This network encompasses various policies that need to be implemented, as well as a strategy for managing materials. Supply chain planning enables businesses to predict and handle customer demands, inventory, and operational risks and opportunities.

**【译文】** 在启动服务或生产产品之前，建立供应链网络至关重要。该网络包含需要实施的各种策略，以及管理物料的战略。供应链规划使企业能够预测和处理客户需求、库存以及运营风险和机遇。

It is important to develop and manage a manufacturing strategy to maintain an organized and structured manufacturing phase in a product’s life cycle. Manufacturing Strategy Management allows users to document a manufacturing strategy for a specific business unit and plan accordingly. Once a strategy is in place, it is necessary to determine the required resources and their quantities.

**【译文】** 制定和管理制造战略对于保持产品生命周期中制造阶段的组织性和结构化非常重要。制造战略管理（Manufacturing Strategy Management）允许用户为特定业务单元记录制造战略并据此进行规划。一旦战略到位，就需要确定所需的资源及其数量。

---

Consequently, creating and managing a service resource plan is a vital component of Service Fulfillment Strategy and Planning. Demand Planning involves a range of processes and functionalities related to demand management, statistical forecasting, promotion, and life cycle planning. It is a critical aspect of an

**【译文】** 因此，创建和管理服务资源计划是“服务履行战略与规划（Service Fulfillment Strategy and Planning）”的重要组成部分。需求规划（Demand Planning）涉及与需求管理、统计预测、促销和生命周期规划相关的一系列流程和功能。它是……的一个关键方面。
